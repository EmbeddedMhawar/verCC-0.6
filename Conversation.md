Akram explains that whenever you create an account, publish a policy, or create a device, it gets stored in IPFS, and the CID is recorded in HCS.

The API keys and config must be set in config.env (example provided with IPFS_TIMEOUT, IPFS_PROVIDER, IPFS_STORAGE_API_KEY).

Comments in the config show optional settings depending on whether the provider is filebase, web3storage, or local.

Guardian handles and automates all of this setup.

Mhawar asks about linking everything and what data is required for validation (IREC1).

Akram clarifies that only sensor data is supported for now.
